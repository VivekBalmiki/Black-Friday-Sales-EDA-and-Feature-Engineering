# 🛍️ Black Friday Sales Customer Purchase Prediction - Personalized Retail Insights

This project aims to predict customer purchase amounts based on demographics, product details, and past purchase data. By leveraging machine learning, we help businesses personalize offers and improve marketing strategies.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Develop a predictive model for estimating customer purchase amounts using demographic and product-related data.
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook.
- **Dataset:** Includes customer demographics, product details, and purchase history.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of two files:
- **train.csv** – Contains historical purchase data, customer information, and product details.
- **test.csv** – Includes new customer-product data for which purchase amounts need to be predicted.

### 🔑 Key Features:
- **Customer Demographics:** Age, Gender, Marital Status, City Type, Duration of Stay.
- **Product Details:** Product ID, Product Category.
- **Target Variable:** Purchase Amount (available only in training data).

## 🛠️ Analysis Performed

### ✅ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Identified and handled missing values.
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Standardized and normalized numerical features.

### ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Examined customer spending behavior.
- Analyzed correlations between features.
- Identified patterns and trends in purchase amounts.

### ✅ Feature Engineering
- Created meaningful new features.
- Transformed existing data for improved model performance.

## 📊 Next Steps - Model Training

🔜 **Upcoming Tasks:**
- Train machine learning models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
- Evaluate models using metrics like RMSE and R².
- Fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.
- Predict purchase amounts on test data.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VivekBalmiki/Black-Friday-Sales-EDA-and-Feature-Engineering.git
   cd Black-Friday-Sales-EDA-and-Feature-Engineering
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Open Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Run the Notebook:** Execute each cell to preprocess data, perform EDA, and train models.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Implement **deep learning models** for enhanced accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a **REST API** for real-time predictions.
- Build an **interactive dashboard** for data visualization.
